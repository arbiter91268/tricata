The Game of Tricata.  There are 27 cards in the deck.

While the game is generally played by two people, I have found it's possible to increase the number of players.  This makes for a longer and more challanging game.

Cards have 3 elements:
numbers (1, 2, 3);
colors (purple, red, gree); and
characters (girl, demon, gentleman).

Players are dealt 3 cards face up. 
The deck is placed then in the center face down, with 1 card placed next to it face up beginning the Discard Pile. 

The object of the game is to make Tricata--All 3 cards matching with 2 elements:

The same color and symbol, OR
The same number and color, OR
The same number and symbol.

Each player picks one card - either from the Deck or the top of the Discard Pile.
If they choose from the deck, then can then either replace a card in their hand and put the unwanted card on top of the discard pile or they can put the drawn card straight on the discard pile if they don't want to keep it.
If the player has chosen to draw from the top of the discard pile, it generally means they want that card to go into their hand, since you can see the discard pile cards and know it would fit into your hand.

The first player to match all 3 cards with 2 elements wins the hand by delcaring Tricata!
The first to win 3 hands, wins the game!

An few of examples of winning hands:

All 3 cards red (matching colour) and all 3 cards the girl (matching character).  So the cards in this hand of course are numbered 1,2,3
(Red Girl 1, Red Girl 2, Red Girl 3)

All 3 cards the demon (matching character) and all 3 cards the same number (matching number).  This means the cards in this winning hand are all going to be a different colour.
(Purple Demon 2, Red Demon 2, Green Demon 2)

All 3 cards blue (matching colour) and all 3 cards the same number (matching number).  So the cards in this hand all have different characters.
(Purple Gentleman 3, Red Gentleman 3, Green Gentleman 3)


ADVANCED GAME PLAY OPTIONS - you can activate these rules separately, or for even more challange - activate these rules at the same time:

Up the Ante Tricata -

Play begins with an ante of chips. Each player is dealt three cards FACE DOWN. The player turns two face up that the other player can see, and holds a 'secret' card face down. ("Secret" cards can be played the same as normal cards, just make sure the secret card remains face down when replaced by a new card.) 
Before beginning a turn, each player has the option to place a bet. His/her opponent can match the bet, raise it, or drop out. The player then has the choice to announce when they have a winning hand (It can be profitable, but risky, to hold a secret winning hand to try increase the bet before turning over to declare you have won.)

Royal Chaos - 

Royal Chaos is a winning hand where no elements match.  An example of a winning hand in this rule would look as follows:
(Purple Girl 1, Red Gentleman 2, Green Demon 3)

A Royal Chaos beats a standard Tricata hand. If there is more than one Royal Chaos, the first to be declared wins.
